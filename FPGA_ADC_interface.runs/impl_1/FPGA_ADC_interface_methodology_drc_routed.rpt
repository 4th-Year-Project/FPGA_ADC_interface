2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks CLK_4MHZ and CLK_4MHZ_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks CLK_4MHZ] -to [get_clocks CLK_4MHZ_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks CLK_4MHZ and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks CLK_4MHZ] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#3 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks CLK_4MHZ_1 and CLK_4MHZ are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks CLK_4MHZ_1] -to [get_clocks CLK_4MHZ]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#4 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks CLK_4MHZ_1 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks CLK_4MHZ_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-8#1 Warning
No common period between related clocks  
The clocks CLK_4MHZ and CLK_4MHZ_1 are found related (timed together) but have no common (expandable) period
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-8#2 Warning
No common period between related clocks  
The clocks CLK_4MHZ and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 are found related (timed together) but have no common (expandable) period
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.833 ns between CONVST_reg/C (clocked by CLK_4MHZ_1) and CONVST_reg/D (clocked by CLK_4MHZ). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.110 ns between CLK_2MHZ_reg/C (clocked by CLK_4MHZ_1) and CLK_2MHZ_reg/D (clocked by CLK_4MHZ). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.887 ns between CLK_4MHZ_reg/Q (clocked by CLK_4MHZ_1) and CLK_4MHZ_reg/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
